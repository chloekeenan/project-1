# Current Features
 
 - An attractive responsive design that works with screens up to 320 pixels wide.
Each external link has an appropriate aria label and opens in a new tab.
Sign up with a link to the user's success page.


# Future Features

- A feature of a reservation option that lets you pick the room of your choice.

- Adding a map showing the retreat's location
adding video footage of actual meditation practice.

- I haven't made a 404 page because the site is only a four-page static static site; but, if the features grow and there may be dead links, I will develop a 404 page.


# Testing 

- Chrome Developer Tools to test the responsiveness of pages The site was tested on Safari, a desktop computer, an iPad, and an iphone 12.

- No photos are pixelated or stretched on the website, which is responsive on all screen sizes. Nothing overlaps.

- Every link on the website has been checked to ensure that it operates as intended, opens in the proper tab, and, if it is an external link, opens in a new browser tab.
